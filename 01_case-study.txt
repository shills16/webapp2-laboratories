In January 2024, our IT company started a highly ambitious 
project to create a cutting-edge software solution, with a 
June 1 launch date. Despite meticulous planning, as the 
deadline approaches, numerous important tasks remain 
unfinished, bugs are unresolved, and the testing phase--crucial
for ensuring product qualityâ€”has yet to begin. This case 
study examines the flaws that caused these delays and provides
solutions that may have been done to avoid such problems.

One of the primary causes of the delays was poor project 
planning and scope management. The project was meticulously 
planned, however it appears that the scope was not well defined 
or controlled. 

The project had incomplete tasks and unresolved bugs, which 
indicated problems with task prioritisation and resource allocation. 
A lack of clear priorities can result in important tasks being 
overlooked and resources being stretched too thin.



Recommendations:
* Establish precise, measurable objectives and needs for the project 
from the start. This helps to maintain focus and ensures that all 
team members understand the goals of the project.
* Implement a strict change control process. Before approval, all 
suggested scope adjustments should be reviewed in terms of their 
impact on the schedule, resources, and budget.
* Regularly assess and adjust resource allocation to ensure that 
high-priority tasks are adequately staffed and supported. This 
could include reassigning team members or bringing in new resources.
